“I don't care what society thinks <br>
They're nothing anyway <br>
They're no better than me <br>
Out there you just have to fit into a pattern that <br/> somebody's already laid out for you <br/>
Life we live, you have to set your own patterns, <br/> your own ideals <br>
You have to handle the whole job yourself”
